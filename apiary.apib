for the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) tool.

# Group Authentication
CleverAnalytics uses OAuth as an authentication protocol.
Authorization process has two steps:

Firstly, you provide an user email and password to get an unique refresh token with validity during the browser session or 90 days (remember me). There can be more then one active refresh token for your account at the same time. Thanks to it you can use separate refresh tokens in your laptop, mobile phone and tablet application.
Refresh token is set as server cookie, with httpOnly flag - forbiden access from e.g. JS Client. 

Secondly, you will use the valid refresh token to obtain an access token that is necessary for authentication all request. There must be set a HTTP Header Authentication: Bearer... Access token is a JWT Token and  has a limited validity to 15 minutes, is encrypted, and can be very quickly verified by the resource servers.

For a detailed insight into authentication see our [blog post](http://blog.cleveranalytics.com/post/106512852494/implementing-token-based-authentication-in-a).

## Error Codes

## Search [/rest/projects/{projectId}/search{?query,dataset,size,page}]

### Search [GET] 

Full text search on all internal project data.
The search searvice indexes `title` and `subtitle` of all geometry datasets (`geometryPoint`, `geometryLine`, `geometryPolygon`).
The dataset's objects are indexed during dataset pull job. It means that if the `title` or `subtitle` definition is changed in dataset's metadata definition, the affected dataset must be loaded again by dataset pull full load process.

+ Parameters 
    + projectId: `vb2b3d8v91jao331` (string) - The ID of an actual project
    + query: `Birmingham` (string) - Query search phrase. It is split into terms and the resource return dataset's object that contains all terms in their `title` or `subtitle`. 
    + dataset: `district` (optional, string[]) - Search only in given dataset. If the parameter present, only the search results of given datasets are returned.       Parameter can be repeated, e.g. `&dataset=orders&dataset=customers`
    + size = `20` (optional, number)

# Group Data Warehouse Service
## DWH Query [/rest/projects/{projectId}/dwh/query{?size,page,sort}]
### Run Query [POST] 
Executes a multidimensional query on datawarehouse. 
Thanks to the query language you are just defining which properities do you want to get 
and you do not case about how get the data. 
The querying properties can be from any datasets (if there is some connection between datasets).

Query service applies a GROUP BY operation on all properties that are NOT aggregated.
In the example bellow the query in SQL syntax would look like: 
```
SELECT 
    catchment_areas.zsj_d_id as zsj_d_id, 
    count(catchment_areas.store_id) as stores_count, 
    avg(transactions.cart_value) as cart_avg 
WHERE customers.customer_value > 1000 
GROUP BY catchment_areas.zsj_d_id
```

List of supported aggregation function:
* function_avg
* function_sum
* function_count
* function_count_dist
* function_max
* function_min
* function_stddev_samp
* function_stddev_pop
* function_var_samp
* function_var_pop

List of supported window functions:
* function_ntile
* function_rank
* function_percentile

List of supported arithmetic functions:
* function_plus
* function_minus
* function_multiply
* function_divide
* function_modulo

List of supported conditional functions:
* ifnull - define the default value to use if the result of aggregation function is null

The WHERE cause of statement is represent by *filterBy* array. The results must match ALL of filters, there is an AND condition between them.
These functions can be used for comparing property with a value: 
* eq
* in
* ne
* lt
* lte
* gt
* gte
* isNull
* isNotNull
* inAttribute

Boolean operators for building advanced conditions:
* and - requires at least two arguments (subconditions)
* or - requires at least two arguments (subconditions)
* not - requires just one argument

## DWH Available Datasets [/rest/projects/{projectId}/dwh/availableDatasets{?subtype,expand}]
### Available Datasets [POST] 
List datasets available for drill in for given metric(s). 

The project's data model defines the relations among datasets. Not all metrics are computable at all datasets granularity.
E.g. population defined on State level cannot be calculated for granularity (dataset) city. 

This endpoint checks the relations from data model and lists only the available datasets for the metrics.

+ Parameters 
    + subtype (optional, string[]) available datasets of subtypes

        If the parameter present, only the datasets of given subtype(s) are returned.
        Parameter can be repeated, e.g. `?subtype=geometryLine&subtype=geometryPolygon`

        Supported types

        + Values
            + `geometryPoint`
            + `geometryLine`    
            + `geometryPolygon`
            
    + expand: `dataset` (enum[String], optional)

## DWH Values Distribution [/rest/projects/{projectId}/dwh/valuesDistribution{?property,buckets,min,max}]

### Values Distribution [GET] 

Computes distribution (frequency) of given fact (numeric dataset property). Result is splitted into required 
number of equal size buckets. The frequency is the count of occurencies of given metric in these buckets.

+ Parameters 
    + projectId: `vb2b3d8v91jao331` (string) - The ID of an actual project
    + property: `baskets.amount` (required, string) - The name of a property
    + buckets: `3` (optional, number) - Number of buckets to split results into
    + min (optional, number) - Set minimal value for distribution. By default it is a minimal value for the property.
    + max (optional, number) - Set maximal value for distribution. By default it is a maximal value for the property.

## DWH Metric Values Distribution [/rest/projects/{projectId}/dwh/metricValuesDistribution]
### Metric Values Distribution [POST] 
Executes a multidimensional query and returns the data distribution of given metric. The resource is typically used for preparing data for histogram chart.

#### Distribution methods
There are currently supported two distribution methods for counting number of elements.

Each method has a custom parameter in request body (see request examples bellow):

* `buckets` (int) - number of bucket for the dynamic splitting
* `breakpoints` (array<number>) - array of breakpoints for static segments

###### Dynamic buckets split
Metric range is splitted into required number of equal size buckets. The frequency is the count of occurencies of given metric in these buckets.
The range values depends on a granularity - that is defined by query properties.

###### Static breakpoints for segments
Executes a multidimensional query and returns the number of records in each segment. Segments are defined as static breakpoints of the metric distribution.
To the first segment are counted all regions whose value of metric is between `<breakpoint[0], breakpoint[1]>`.
The interval for second segment is `(breakpoint[1], breakpoint[2]>`.
And the last segment is `(breakpoint[last-1], breakpoint[last]>`.
The minimal required number of breakpoints is 2, it returns count of elements in one segment.


Returns:
* 200 - ok
* 400 - bad request 
    * 400006 - metric values distribution for given metric and filters is not supported. The min and max values equals and therefore cannot be splitted into buckets.

## DWH Upload [/rest/projects/{projectId}/dwh/data/uploads]
### Upload Data [POST] 
This resource allows to upload the data file (CSV) to internal storage. 

####Upload flow:
1. Create a new upload file by `POST /rest/projects/{projectId}/dwh/data/uploads`
1. Resource generates the new upload `uploadId` with a S3 pre-signed URL `uploadUrl`.
1. Upload the CSV file by `PUT {uploadUrl}` (no other authentication is required)

The pre-signed URL can be used by any HTTP tool. You can upload the content to the URL without any additional authorization (no bearer token needed).
Example of upload CSV file on signed URL by *curl*:
